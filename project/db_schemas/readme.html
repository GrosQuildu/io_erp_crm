<h2>Introduction</h2>

You can extend the SchemaCrawler distribution by downloading additional libraries that SchemaCrawler integrates with, such as the Spring Framework, Groovy, Ruby, Python and so on. You can also download additional JDBC drivers, and have SchemaCrawler pick them up automatically. Once you are happy with the customization of your installation, you can copy the <code>_schemacrawler</code> folder to any location on your system, and use it from there.</p>
